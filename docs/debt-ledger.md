# Debt ledger

Known deviations from the rules in `CLAUDE.md` that are kept on purpose. Each line says what the
debt is, why it stays, what pins it so it cannot grow, and what would retire it. A debt with no
counter is a grave: it gets added to and nobody notices. A line leaves this file in the commit that
pays it.

| Since | Debt | Why it stays | Pinned by | Retired by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-17 | 16 migrations across 6 stamps share a timestamp (`2026_08_08_125139`, `2026_09_01_100000`, `2026_09_01_120000`, `2026_09_01_130000`, `2026_09_15_120000`, `2026_09_16_130000`). The rule — one unique stamp per file — applies to new files only. | Renaming a migration that has already run makes every deployed database see it as new and try to run it again. | `tests/Architecture/MigrationTimestampTest.php` lists the sixteen by name and fails on any other shared stamp. | Nothing planned. A pair leaves the pin only if a data migration proves the rename safe on every environment. |
